# Getting Started

This project was initialized using [AIO Project Initializer](https://github.com/DeeshanSharma/aio-project-initializer).

## Available Scripts

You could run the following commands in the project directory:

### `yarn start / npm start`

Runs the server in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser or your respective frontend link.

This uses Nodemon to serve the files for seamless development.

The page will reload as soon as you make edits.

### `yarn build / npm run build`

Builds the server for production to the `dist` folder.\
It compiles TypeScript code to JavaScript according to the config specified in the tsconfig file.

> _**NOTE:** You may uncomment the lower two lines in the `tsconfig.json` file which will emit the type declaration files for the code in `dist/@type` directory._
