# Getting Started

This project was initialized using [AIO Project Initializer](https://github.com/DeeshanSharma/aio-project-initializer).

## Available Scripts

You could run the following commands in the project directory:

### `yarn start / npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

This uses Webpack Dev Server to serve the files in Development mode.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also show any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build / npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

It uses Webpack and Babel to do that.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
